Level Cap
Once a Pokémon reaches a level cap the Infinite Candy item will no longer work and the Pokémon will not gain any experience in battles or Day Care.
The level cap is tied boss fights and raised as you defeat them, progressing through the story.
The boss fights are noted in documentation and are also noticeable by the battle transition as they start.
You can overcome the cap by using Rare Candies, but those are rare and limited.
Here is a list of all the bosses and their matching level caps:

Elder Li 			lvl 12
Leader Falkner 			lvl 16
Slowpoke-Well Proton 		lvl 20
Leader Bugsy 			lvl 25
Schorsch 			lvl 30
